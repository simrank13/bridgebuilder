This project builds a command line game where the user can choose the easy mode or hard mode in which the user will act as a civil engineer adn will construct a bridge across a vast lake where the swamp is in the bottom right corner and in the hard mode the rival group has hired their own automated engineer to intervene in your bridge construction.
